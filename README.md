# AI Insights for DHIS2

AI Insights allows users to analyze DHIS2 health data using natural language queries. Healthcare professionals, data analysts, and decision-makers can ask questions in plain language to identify trends, compare performance across organization units, and generate actionable insights from their data.

## Overview

This application connects directly to your DHIS2 instance and uses AI to help you understand your health data better. The app works by connecting to external AI services (OpenAI or locally-hosted Ollama) to interpret questions and analyze aggregate, event, and tracker data. AI Insights is generic and works with any DHIS2 instance and metadata structure.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [DHIS2 Application Platform](https://github.com/dhis2/app-platform).

### Prerequisites
- A running DHIS2 instance (v2.35 or later)
- For OpenAI: An internet connection and OpenAI API key
- For local models: Ollama installed with your preferred models

## Installation Options

### From Built Package:
1. Download the `.zip` file from the build/bundle directory
2. Log in to your DHIS2 instance as an administrator
3. Go to App Management
4. Click "Upload App" and select the downloaded zip file

### Development Setup:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3. Configure your DHIS2 server in `.env.development`
4. Run `yarn start` for development mode

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner and runs all available tests found in `/src`.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
A deployable `.zip` file can be found in `build/bundle`!

### `yarn deploy`

Deploys the built app in the `build` folder to a running DHIS2 instance.<br />
You must run `yarn build` before running `yarn deploy`.

## How to Use DHIS2 AI Insights

### Initial Setup

1. After installation, open the app from your DHIS2 dashboard
